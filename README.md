# Staffing Spreadsheet Project

This is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet project that uses Visual Basic to help automate a few things.
It gives a visual of the staffing coverage for a work day, and it can be used to assign staffing across several zones.
Note: For now, this spreadsheet is structured specifically for use at our workplace. 
It was built to help us plan the staffing at work each day.
